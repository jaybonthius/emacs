;; The outline-indent Emacs package provides a minor mode that enables code
;; folding based on indentation levels.
;;
;; In addition to code folding, *outline-indent* allows:
;; - Moving indented blocks up and down
;; - Indenting/unindenting to adjust indentation levels
;; - Inserting a new line with the same indentation level as the current line
;; - Move backward/forward to the indentation level of the current line
;; - and other features.
